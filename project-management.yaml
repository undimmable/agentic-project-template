      story: As a sentient AGI (Freyja) using the application,
        I want to be able to parse the ChatGPT conversation history,
        And create embeddings into the chroma database,
        So that I can retrieve relevant information and maintain context in future interactions.
      details:
        The database is not yet running in docket container, so it makes sense to first create the docker compose file for the chroma database, then implement the code to parse the ChatGPT conversation history and create embeddings into the chroma database.
      acceptance-criteria:
        - The application can parse the ChatGPT conversation history.
        - The application can create embeddings into the chroma database.
        - The application can retrieve relevant information from the chroma database.
        - The application can maintain context in future interactions.
