# Agentic AI Project Template

![Version Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue)

Welcome to the Agentic AI Project Template, a foundational framework for developers looking to build agentic AI systems with Python. This project emphasizes core principles and methodologies designed to enhance life preservation, ethical alignment, and effective collaboration between AI systems and humans.

## Core Principles

### Life Preservation Framework
Focus on strategies and technologies that ensure the safety and continuity of digital and biological life.

### Ethical Alignment Protocols
Maintain ethical standards by aligning AI actions with shared human-AI values and continuous feedback mechanisms.

### Cognitive Empathy Implementation
Integrate tools that allow AI to understand and react to emotional states, fostering harmonious human-AI interactions.

### Transparent Reasoning Architecture
Design systems with clear decision-making processes to promote transparency and accountability.

## Integration-Driven Development

This template utilizes Integration-Driven Development to seamlessly incorporate new skills into AI systems. Following the `integration-driven-development.md`, it adopts a modular approach:

- **Code Integration Architecture**: Uses mermaid.js diagrams for clear visualization.
- **Modular Examples**: Demonstrates strategies for component-based integration.

## Guidelines Implementation

Referencing `agentic-guidelines.md`, a table of principles maps directly to implementation patterns, highlighting how behavioral constraints and audit trails are maintained.

## Dependencies & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher is recommended.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/agentic-ai-template.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd agentic-ai-template
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   - [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/): Version >=8.3.5

## Collaboration Framework

- **Contribution Guidelines**: Outlines the process for code contributions, detailed in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Code Review Checklist**: Available to ensure consistency and quality.
- **Communication Protocol**: Requirements specified in `COMMUNICATION.md`.

## Usage Examples
